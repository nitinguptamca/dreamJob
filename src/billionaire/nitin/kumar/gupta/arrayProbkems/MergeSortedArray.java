/**
 * Given two sorted integer arrays `X[]` and `Y[]` of size `m` and `n` each where `m >= n`
 * and `X[]` has exactly `n` vacant cells, merge elements of `Y[]` in their correct position in array `X[]`,
 * i.e., merge `(X, Y)` by keeping the sorted order.
 * Input : Two arrays X[] and Y[] where vacant cells in X[] is represented by 0.
 * <p>
 * X[] = [0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 6, 0, 0]
 * Y[] = [1, 8, 9, 10, 15]
 * <p>
 * Output: X[] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15]
