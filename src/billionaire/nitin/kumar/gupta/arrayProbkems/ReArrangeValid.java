/**
 * Given an integer array, rearrange it such that every second element becomes greater than its left and right elements.
 * <p>
 * • Assume that no duplicate elements are present in the input array.
 * • The solution should perform single traveral of the array.
 * • In case the multiple rearrangement exists, the solution can return any one of them.
 * <p>
 * Input : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
 * Output: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6] or [1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4], or any other valid combination..
 * <p>
 * Input : [6, 9, 2, 5, 1, 4]
 * Output: [6, 9, 2, 5, 1, 4] or [1, 5, 2, 6, 4, 9], or any other valid combination..
